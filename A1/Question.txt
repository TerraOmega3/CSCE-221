Question #1. What is a data structure?
4
A data structure is a systematic way of organizing input data and specifying operations which can be performed on this data.
A hexagon of numbers and letters
Buildings that contain information servers
A header file

Question #2. Which of these is a c++ abstract data type?
5
int
string
double
vector
char
4

Question #3. What is an abstract data type?
3
a class with virtual member functions
model that specifies the type of the data stored the operations that support the data, without implementation
graphical data type that resembles abstract art

Question #4. How would you correctly use an initialization list in c++11?
3
int a{1,2,3,4};
int a(1,2,3,4};
int a[4]{1,2,3,4};

Question #5. Which of these is NOT a control statement in c++?
5
for (int i=0;i<n;++n);
while (n>0);
if (n);
n=0;
switch (n):
4

Question #6. What is NOT an advantage of a linked list?
3
direct access to elements
easy and effecient insert and delete
size can easily and effeciently be increased and decreased

Question #7. A compiler links object code together?
2
True
False

Question #8. A linker creates object code from c++ source code?
2
True
False

Question #9. Which of these is a type of relationship data structures can have?
4
linear

Question #10. Which of these is not a typical operation on a data structure?
5
insert
delete
hide
search
sort

Question #11. How would you declare a class the STL library with T=type?
4
vector type;
matrix a(type);
<list> type();
map<type> m;

Question #12. What is an advantage of a vector over using an array?
3
smaller overhead
size can be changed without explicitly calling the new operator
no range checking
2

Question #13. How would you specify an API(application programming interface) in c++?
4
with a class using only virtual functions
with code implemented in a main.cpp
with a preproccessing command
with a defined struct
1

Question #14. Which one is a major difference between java and c++?
5
ability to define user types
control statements such as if for and while
use of pointer to object types
ability to define and call functions
high level code abstraction
